# Enum.ForceLimitMode

The **ForceLimitMode** enum determines how the maximum force for a constraint is specified and how that limit is enforced by the constraint.

## Items

| Name | Value | Tags | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Magnitude` | 0 |  | A single number is used to specify the magnitude of the maximum constraint force. The constraint will ensure that the force it applies will have a magnitude that is less than this limit. |
| `PerAxis` | 1 |  | A vector is used to specify the maximum force value along each axis of a given reference frame. The constraint will ensure that each component of the force will have an absolute value that's less than the corresponding vector entry. |

**Valid values:** `Enum.ForceLimitMode.Magnitude`, `Enum.ForceLimitMode.PerAxis`
